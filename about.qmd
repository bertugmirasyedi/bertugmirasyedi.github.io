 I'm BertuÄŸ Mirasyedi, from Istanbul, Turkey. On this blog, I will share my data science learning journey with projects that I find interesting. Occasionally the posts could include about multi-criteria decision analysis too - and maybe mathematical optimization. 

I'm actually a mechanical engineer by training; however, inference from **data** *and* trying to make optimal **decisions** has always fascinated me. I have started learning about data science and specifically about machine learning with the first Coronavirus lockdowns as a hobby. I have successfully finished Google's *Machine Learning Crash Course* and that has laid a solid foundation for me.

Even though I did a few self projects earlier, now I want to fully concentrate on my data science skills and thought that creating a blog about these projects would help me to see my progress (and could serve others as a tutorial).
