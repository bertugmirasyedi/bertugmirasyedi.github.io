On this blog, I will share my data science learning journey with projects that I find interesting. Occasionally the posts could include about multi-criteria decision analysis too - and maybe mathematical optimization. \n\nI'm actually a mechanical engineer by training; however, inference from **data** *and* trying to make optimal **decisions** has always fascinated me. I have started learning about data science and specifically about machine learning with the first Coronavirus lockdowns as a hobby. I have successfully finished Google's *Machine Learning Crash Course* and that has laid a solid foundation for me.\n\nEven though I did a few self projects earlier, now I want to fully concentrate on my data science skills and thought that creating a blog about these projects would help me to see my progress (and could serve others as a tutorial)."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"flatly","title":"About","image":"/images/bertug.jpeg","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/bertugmirasyedi"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertug-mirasyedi/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/bertugmirasyedi"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
